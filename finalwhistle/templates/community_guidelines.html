                <p>
                    Participation in The Final Whistle website constitutes agreement to the following guidelines, which
                    apply to posts, profile information, any other content on this site and participation in general.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Because of the live nature of the discussions on this community, it is not possible for us to review
                    and/or confirm the accuracy or validity of a message before it is posted. If you believe that someone
                    has violated our User Guidelines or you have spotted content that may otherwise require attention,
                    please contact us with a link to the content and a brief description of what you believe is wrong.
                    Notification is voluntary and anonymous, but in no case should a user respond to a situation personally,
                    thereby aggravating the situation further. Responding to a violation in an inflammatory manner is a
                    violation in itself and will result in appropriate action.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Any content that violates our User Guidelines will be removed. Interpretation of our guidelines is
                    at the discretion of staff.

                            Advertisements are not allowed. Generally speaking, posts made specifically for the promotion
                            of a website, product or service are considered advertising or, at least, posts made that
                            unnecessarily send people to a website that you are in some way affiliated with. It does not
                            matter if it is a commercial website, a personal website, a non profit website, etc.
                        </p>

                            You are not allowed to post an affiliate URL that leads to you earning cash, banner impressions,
                            credits, points, etc.

                            Do not post personal, real-life information such as home addresses and home phone numbers.

                            As this is an English-speaking community, we require that posted content be in the English
                            language, so that it can be well received and properly monitored.
                        </p>

                            Vulgar language and inappropriate material is not allowed and will be removed. Abbreviations,
                            self censoring, and attempts to circumvent the word censoring feature of the community software
                            also violate this guideline. If your post contains a word that is censored by the software,
                            you must remove that word or the post will be removed. If you feel that the censor is acting
                            in error, please <a href="{{ url_for('contact_us') }}">contact us</a>.

                            We try to maintain a family friendly atmosphere whenever it is possible within the main subject
                            matter of this community. Please keep this in mind when participating.

                            When linking to outside websites, you must ensure that the content of the link is appropriate
                            for our community, in line with the guidelines laid out here. This includes mentioning or
                            referencing a site, even if the mention is not hyperlinked. If you post a link and that link
                            is automatically censored, it is considered to be an inappropriate link and you should remove
                            it from your post immediately. If left, all posts that feature inappropriate links will be removed.
                        </p>

                            Posts that discuss illegal activities, transactions, or websites that are involved in illegal
                            activities will be removed. This includes the posting of information that you have obtained
                            illegally.
                        </p>

                            Political and religious discussions are not allowed on this website. If it is believed that
                            the end result of a discussion will be political or religious, the post may be removed.
                            Likewise, strong political and religious sentiments should be kept out of profiles, signatures,
                            and other content.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Do not post copyrighted materials (articles, videos, audio, etc.) that you do not have permission
                            to reproduce or distribute. For text articles, most of the time you may quote a small portion
                            of the article (usually no more than 1/5 or 1/6) and you must link to the source (if online)
                            or provide the source (if offline). Posting the entire article, even with the source, constitutes
                            copyright infringement.
                        </p>

                            When posting and linking to images, videos, files, etc., please refrain from hotlinking. This
                            is the direct linking to images (.jpg, .jpeg, .gif, .png, etc.), video (.avi, .mov, .mpg,
                            .mpeg, .wmv, etc.), audio (.mp3, .wav, etc.), archives (.zip, .rar, etc.) or otherwise
                            downloadable or streamable files, on servers that you do not have permission to link to,
                            instead of linking to the page where the item can be found. This includes providing a direct
                            link to the file, even if that file is not embedded into your post. This practice costs the
                            server owner money and resources.
                        </p>

                            Respect is the name of the game. You must respect your fellow members. Please refrain from
                            inflammatory and defamatory comments as well as flaming, taunting, and general disrespect.
                            Do not simply put down the opinion or advice given by others. If you don't agree with it,
                            say why - respectfully. Don't just tell them they're wrong. Do not make uninvited remarks
                            about typos, duplicate posts, posting styles, etc.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            When an opinion-based discussion is being had, do not state things like "there is no argument"
                            as if your opinion is the only one or the only one that matters. When someone has clearly
                            stated their opinion, do not say things like "Are you serious?" and "Are you kidding me?"
                            Remember, this is not a debate club. This is a friendly discussion community. Allow people
                            to have their opinion. No one is to act as some sort of opinion judge, responding to each one
                            to say whether they agree with it or whether it is a valid, well thought out opinion.

                            longer are. You may request an item to be removed at any time, but we will decide when and if
                            to remove content from our community. If you wish to no longer be identified with our community,
                            we will be glad to close your account and alter your profile information to remove all identifying
                            characteristics. After account closure, you will no longer be able to participate in this
                            community and this action is not reversible.
